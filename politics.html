            <p>
                A small town in Idaho has recently had a rather controversial candidate <br>
                running for mayor. Lucky, a labrador retriever. While much of the feedback <br>
                from the citizens has been positive, others regard it as a joke that <br>
                should be discontinued. As of right now however, it looks like lucky will <br>
                indeed be in the running.
