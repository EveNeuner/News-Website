            <p>
                Scientists in Massachusets have been conducting a study that has raised <br>
                some questions. Using mice in teams A, B, and C, they are attempting <br>
                to test the benefits of using orbeez, small water beads, beneath plastic <br>
                wrap as a form of padding. To test this they equiped team A with orbeez <br>
                padding, team B with standard padding, and team C with no padding. They <br>
                then taught the mice to play football. While the results are still pending, <br>
                this study has certainly peaked our interest. Some reactions have been <br>
                positive, with some stating that they believe this will be a revolutionary <br>
                moment in sports equitment history. Others feel that the study is cruel to <br>
                the animals. But the majority of the public finds the study entertaining <br>
                and is simply along for the ride.
