            <p>
                In August of this year, Disney released yet another live action <br>
                adaption of one of their beloved classics. This time, it was toy <br>
                story. Upon release, Disney was met with complaints about the <br>
                movie being "weird" and "creepy." "Something about the real <br>
                people playing the toys kind of ruined it," one viewer stated. <br>
                Clearly, Disney should rethink their adaptions in the future. <br>

            <p>
                Titanic... But Dogs, a remake of the classic movie Titanic, has <br>
                quickly risen to the top of many peoples list. The movie stars a <br>
                cast of dogs, which added to the emotional trauma of the story <br>
                according to listeners. Critics claimed that that the barking dialogue <br>
                took away from the experience, and that having the dogs wear corsets <br>
                was a step too far. But these comments have done nothing to dull the <br>
                public interest.
